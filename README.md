# MITRE-ATT&CK

# Objective

The objective of this lab was to understand and apply the MITRE ATT&CK framework within a threat intelligence context using the TryHackMe MITRE ATT&CK room. The lab focused on learning how adversary behaviors are categorized into tactics and techniques, how observed activity can be mapped to ATT&CK, profilling Advanced Persistent Threat(APT's), and how this framework supports threat intelligence analysis, detection development, and incident response.
